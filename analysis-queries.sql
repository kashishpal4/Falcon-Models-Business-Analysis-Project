-- Project: Falcon Models - Sales & Customers Analysis
-- File: Analysis-queries.sql [By Kashish Pal]
-- Description: This file contains SQL queries used for 
-- credit & payment analysis, customer segmentation, and 
-- business insights for the Falcon Models dataset.
-- ====================================================================================

-- Overview of Queries:
-- â€¢ Joined multiple tables (customers, orders, payments, products) for integrated analysis  
-- â€¢ Created new columns for sales, profit, payment gaps, and payment performance  
-- â€¢ Assessed customer credit risk based on credit limits and payment behavior  
-- â€¢ Built customer scores using sales, profit, and payment gap metrics  
-- â€¢ Segmented customers into tiers (VIP, Premium, Regular) for business insights
